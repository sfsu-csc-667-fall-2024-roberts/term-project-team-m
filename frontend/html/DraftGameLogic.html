File Purpose:
Early Draft version of the game in an HTML document, with javascript implementing the game logic
I wanted to get the game logic set up and working before trying to integrate it with the database

Description: 
This HTML file contains the early draft logic for the shithead card game.
The game logic includes functions for starting the game, creating the deck, shuffling the deck,
managing player hands, playing cards, updating the UI, and handling game state transitions (start of game, game over).
Additionally, error messages are displayed to inform players about invalid moves.
Players can interact with the game by clicking on cards in their hand to try and play them,
and click on the pile to pick it up.
The game continues until all but one player's hand is empty (and that last player is the ... shithead).

The game follows the rules of the version of Shithead that I learned from a friend overseas.
With the special cards, 2, 8, 9, 10. Where 2, 8, 10 can be played on anything, but 9 requires it to be 9 or lower
2 sets the value of the pile to 2, so it's a value "reset" so you can play low cards again
8 is essentially invisible, and it stores the value of the thing played before it,
so the card sequence K -> 8,  the 8 would equal the king (13), so you'd have to play a K or A to beat it (or a special card)
10 destroys the pile and the player who played it gets to go again
9 is a high-value nullifier, as it requires a 9 or lower to be played on it (so you can't play a J, K, Q, A)

________________
TO DO :
________________
REQUIRED FEATURES:

REQUIRED LATER
* Add Face Up and Face Down cards
* Add the ability to play multiple of the same card in the same turn

WOULD LIKE TO HAVES:
* Migrate javascript to an external file, and call it here, so users can't modify the code by editing
* Add the ability to have more or less than 3 players
Add an AI player option
* Hard difficulty would do the most optimal move always, like pick the lowest value thing in it's hand to get rid of those first
* Normal difficulty would intentionally sometimes do bad moves (like pick randomly from the list of possible moves)


Finished to do's:
* Cards respect expected rules
* If a players hand is empty and they have no face down or face ups, they are a "winner" and are no longer involved in the game
                        ^ Skip the above players turn if that is the case
* Add the quartets functionality, if there are 4 of the same card in a row on the pile,
  then destroy the pile and the current player goes again
* Have hands sorted by numerical value
