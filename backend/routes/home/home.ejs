      <!-- Game Description -->
      <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-300">
        Shithead is a variation of the game Palace, (also known as Shed, Karma, or Castle).
        Like Palace, players aim to be the first to get rid of all their cards to avoid
        becoming the “shithead”.
        <br><br>
        In Shithead, players are dealt an initial hand of 3 cards, 3 face-down cards, and 3-faceup cards. The remaining deck
        is placed face down and acts as a draw pile. Players (will eventually) be allowed to swap out their face-up cards with
        cards from their hand at the start of the game, before the first play is made.
        <br><br>
        The game cycles through the players,
        allowing them to play a card from their hand onto the central “pile”, which in most cases follows numerical
        superiority rules, with the exception of the special cards. If a player is unable to beat the current value on the
        pile they have to pick it up and add those cards to their hand. If there are still cards in the draw deck, and a
        player has less than 3 cards in their hand, they will need to draw cards from the draw deck to reach 3 cards, as long
        as the draw deck remains.
        <br><br>
        The winning condition in Shithead is different from regular Palace, in that in Shithead, all players who play [all of
        their hand, face-up, and face-down cards] are winners, and there is only one loser, that being the last person to do
        so.
